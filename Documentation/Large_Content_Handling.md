# Handling Large Content Updates in GitHub API

## 1. Maximum Payload Size Limit for GitHub API Requests
The GitHub API typically has a payload size limit of around 100 MB for most API requests. However, it's recommended to keep payloads well below this limit to avoid issues.

## 2. Efficiently Handling Large Content Updates
For large content updates, consider compressing the data before encoding it to Base64. Using gzip compression can significantly reduce the size of the content.

## 3. Best Practices for Splitting Large Content
- **Chunking**: Split the content into smaller chunks, each within the payload size limit.
- **Multipart Uploads**: Use multipart uploads to handle large files by uploading them in smaller parts and then combining them on the server side.

## 4. Specific Error Messages Indicating Payload Size Issues
- `RequestEntityTooLarge`: Indicates that the payload size exceeds the allowed limit.
- `413 Payload Too Large`: The server is refusing to process a request because the request payload is larger than the server is willing or able to process.

## 5. Optimizing Base64 Encoding for Large Content
- **Compression**: Compress the content using gzip or another compression method before encoding it to Base64.
- **Incremental Updates**: Break down the updates into smaller, incremental changes rather than attempting to update a large file in a single request.
