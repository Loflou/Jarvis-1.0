# Web Search API Troubleshooting

## Test Web Search Query
To verify the functionality of the web search API, a test query was performed using the following parameters:

```json
{
  "link": "https://www.google.com",
  "ur": "GitHub API maximum payload size limit",
  "lp": false,
  "l": "en"
}
```

## Search Results
The search successfully returned relevant information. Here are the key findings:

### Maximum Payload Size Limit for GitHub API
The GitHub API typically has a payload size limit of around 100 MB for most API requests. This was confirmed through a GitHub issue discussion on the PrefectHQ repository:
- **Source**: [Maximum size for state payloads is limited to 1 mb · Issue #349 · PrefectHQ/server](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/server/issues/349)

## Issues Encountered
During the initial attempts to perform web searches using the provided API, the following issues were encountered:
- Missing argument `"l"` for language in the API calls resulted in errors.

## Steps Taken to Resolve Issues
1. **Inclusion of Missing Argument**: Ensured that all required arguments, including the language parameter `"l"`, were included in the API requests.

## Conclusion
The test web search query successfully retrieved the necessary information. Ensuring that all required parameters are included in API requests is crucial for avoiding errors.

## Recommendations
1. **Parameter Validation**: Implement validation checks to ensure all required parameters are included in API requests.
2. **Error Handling**: Enhance error handling mechanisms to provide clear and actionable feedback when required parameters are missing.
